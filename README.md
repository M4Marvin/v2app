# Charon

> My take on properly building an app that combines features from Chub, SillyTavern, and everything else I always wanted.

Charon is a self-hosted web app for roleplaying with AI characters. Import character cards from SillyTavern or Chub, chat with branching message trees, swipe between replies, and keep everything local.

---

## Features

- **Branching conversations** — every swipe creates a new branch. Navigate freely, edit inline, never lose a reply.
- **Character cards V2 + V3** — import `.png` cards from SillyTavern, Chub, or anywhere. No conversion needed.
- **Your own API key** — BYO OpenAI-compatible provider (OpenAI, Anthropic via proxy, OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, etc.). Keys encrypted at rest.
- **Lorebooks** — attach background lore to a chat. The AI reads relevant entries automatically.
- **Personas** — define multiple personas and switch per chat.
- **Markdown rendering** — bold, italic, code blocks, images, `<style>` scoping, dialogue highlighting. Streaming-safe with fade-in.
- **Self-hosted** — your data stays in a local SQLite file. No cloud, no telemetry, no accounts except yours.

## Quick start

### Option A: Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Data persists in a Docker volume (`charon-data`).
Set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in your environment (or a `.env`
file next to `docker-compose.yml`) — see below for generating them.

### Option B: pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
echo 'DATABASE_URL="dev.db"' > .env
echo 'BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-64-char-secret"' >> .env
echo 'ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-char-secret"' >> .env
pnpm run dev
```

Don't have pnpm? `npm install -g pnpm` or see [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Generate secrets:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 64  # BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
openssl rand -hex 32  # ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

Migrations run automatically on first start — no manual `db:migrate` needed.

## First-time setup

1. Open http://localhost:3000 and **Sign up** — pick a username and password.
2. You'll land in the guided **onboarding wizard**, which takes you through the
   rest: make your account the admin, connect an AI provider, and get a
   character.
3. Click **Start chatting** and you're in — pick a character and type.

Characters not included. Grab some from [Chub](https://chub.ai) or copy `.png` files from a SillyTavern `public/characters/` folder.

### Chat controls

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| **Send** | Type in the composer, press Enter (Enter also stops while the AI is typing) |
| **New line** | Shift+Enter |
| **Swipe** (see alternate replies) | Click the ← / → buttons under an AI message |
| **Regenerate** | Click the circular-arrow button on the last AI message |
| **Edit** | Click the ✏️ icon, edit, click ✓ (or Ctrl/Cmd+Enter; Esc cancels) |
| **Impersonate** | Click the wand icon in the composer, review the draft, press Enter |
| **Continue** | Leave the input empty and press Enter |
| **Delete branch** | Trash icon on any message |
| **Command menu** | Ctrl+K |

## Import from SillyTavern

```bash
# Copy your old data in
cp -r /path/to/SillyTavern/public/* public/data/
pnpm run migrate
```

---

## Production

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run start         # port 3000
```

Set `APP_URL` to your public URL for auth cookies. The production server is the same app, built once.
